Hi! I'm Justin, and I'm focused on AI with Meta's Llama, torchtune, Llama Stack, and React (via Next.js). 

→ My core language is Python, and my secondary language is TypeScript. <br/>
→ My core focus is post-training tasks, i.e. deep learning for finetuning generative AI models. <br/>
→ My core complementary skill is developing Next.js interfaces for lightweight post-training applications. <br/>
→ My portfolio work lives in <a href="https://github.com/theosis-ai" style="text-decoration: none">@theosis-ai</a> <br/>
→ Past work for Lightning AI can be viewed on my [Studios](https://lightning.ai/justin) profile page. <br/>
→ Major open source projects I've contributed to are pinned here, along with post-training cookbooks of mine.
