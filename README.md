## About
Hi! I'm Justin, and I'm focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

→ My core language is Python<br/>
→ My core focus is deep learning for post-training <br/>
→ My secondary focus is building Next.js applications as post-training utilities<br/>
→ Major open source projects I've contributed to are pinned here along with portfolio projects

## Education and Background

→ MS in AI from Drexel University <br/>
→ prior Developer Advocate @ Lightning AI 

## Applied Deep Learning

The following work is self-written and does not use generative coding tools. 

1. [Lightning Lab](https://github.com/jxtngx/lightning-lab): template for research with PyTorch Lightning
2. [Intro to Post Training](https://github.com/jxtngx/intro-to-post-training) learn finetuning with PyTorch's torchtune
3. [NeMo Cookbook](https://github.com/jxtngx/nemo-cookbook) finetuning with NVIDIA's NeMo
4. [Vision Lab](https://github.com/jxtngx/vision-lab): vision transformers
5. [Text Lab](https://github.com/jxtngx/text-lab): text transformers
6. [BERT finetune](https://github.com/jxtngx/bert-finetune): finetune BERT with PyTorch Lightning
7. [ResNet finetune](https://github.com/jxtngx/resnet-finetune): finetune ResNet with PyTorch Lightning
