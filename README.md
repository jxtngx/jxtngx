## About
Hi! I'm Justin, and I'm focused on artificial intelligence solutions and developer education. 

→ My core language is Python, and my secondary language is TypeScript <br/>
→ My core focus is deep learning for post-training <br/>
→ My secondary focus is building Next.js applications <br/>
→ My portfolio work lives in <a href="https://github.com/theosis-ai" style="text-decoration: none">@theosis-ai</a> <br/>
→ Major open source projects I've contributed to are pinned here

## Education and Background

→ MS in AI from Drexel University <br/>
→ prior Developer Advocate @ Lightning AI
