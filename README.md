## About
Hi! I'm Justin, and I'm focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

## Applied Deep Learning

The following work is self-written and does not use generative coding tools. 

1. [Lightning Lab](https://github.com/jxtngx/lightning-lab): template for research with PyTorch Lightning
3. [NeMo Cookbook](https://github.com/jxtngx/nemo-cookbook) finetuning with NVIDIA's NeMo [**recommended**]
6. [BERT finetune](https://github.com/jxtngx/bert-finetune): finetune BERT with PyTorch Lightning
7. [ResNet finetune](https://github.com/jxtngx/resnet-finetune): finetune ResNet with PyTorch Lightning

## AI Assisted Open Source

The following work is 90% or more written alongside generative coding tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot).
