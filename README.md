Hi! I'm Justin, and I'm focused on AI with Meta's Llama, torchtune, Llama Stack, and React (via Next.js). 

→ My core language is Python, and my secondary language is TypeScript. <br/>
→ My core focus is post-training tasks, i.e. deep learning for finetuning generative AI models. <br/>
→ My core complementary skill is developing Next.js interfaces for lightweight post-training applications. <br/>
→ My portfolio work lives in <a href="https://github.com/theosis-ai" style="text-decoration: none">@theosis-ai</a>, and major open source projects I've contributed are pinned here.
